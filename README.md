# TreeMapBC
iOS application built using the MapKit framework that displays the location of 4,000~ trees on Boston College campuses. Each tree annotation includes species information and environmental impact data calculated with i-Tree Eco v6. Tree annotations are dynamically added and removed based on zoom level and tree diameter: smaller trees are removed at lower zoom levels. Filtering by common name, botanical name, tag number, diameter, and campus location is implemented within a side menu. Environmental impact of all filtered trees is calculated when any filters are applied.

# Motivation
We all understand the fact that trees are essential to the wellbeing of our planet, and how deforestation is a major contributor to global warming. However, it is incredibly difficult to quantify their actual environmental impact. By making the annual environmental impact of each tree in our local communities readily accessible to the general public, I hoped to foster an appreciation for the significance of trees, even in our own campuses and backyards, to the fight against climate change.
